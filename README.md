go-zmq-chat
=========

This is a simple chat tool to get into the Go programming language while also learning something about the ZeroMQ security features.
Kudos to https://github.com/jnthnwn/zmq-chat for this simple python version.

This is under development and not finished, yet. That means you cannot chat right now, but there are some dummy clients.
Next:
  * Add security
  * Add user interface

----------

This is one of my first Go programs. Feel free to contribute or send me some hints to improve the program.

Installation
------------
